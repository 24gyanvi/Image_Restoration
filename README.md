# Image_Restoration
Image restoration is one of the most important areas in imaging science. Model-based optimization methods and discriminative learning methods have been the two dominant strategies for solving various inverse problems in low-level vision. This paper aims to train different set of images on different models for denoising and deblurring. For denoising salt pepper and Gaussian Noise is introduced in the datasets, and for deblurring gaussian blur is used to train the model using CNN(Convolutional neural network) and autoencoders on different datasets. This papers uses the metrics accuracy, PSNR and SSIM. Experimental results show that Autoencoders in case of salt pepper denoising,  in case of gaussian noise, in case of deblurring gives the better results.
